# Overview
Firmament Model (FMT Model) is a part of [Firmament Autopilot](https://github.com/FirmamentPilot) project, which includes the simulation framework, such as **model-in-the-loop** , **hardware-in-the-loop** and **open-loop** simulation. Apart from that, the algorithm library is provided which contains various of simulink model including **INS**, **Controller**, **FMS**, **Plant**,  which can be used for different vehicles. These models can generate C/C++ source file and easily integrate into [FMT Firmware](https://github.com/FirmamentPilot/FMT_Firmware).

## Quick Start

FMT Model is mainly developed and tested in **Matlab 2018b**, so it's strongly recommended to use this version. However, it's possible to open the project with higher matlab version, but that is not well tested.

### Initialization

To initialize the project, simply click and run `FMT_Model.prj`, which will do everything for you.

### MIL Simulation

Follow the belowing steps to start MIL simulation:

- Open the MIL simulation model `$FMT_Model/simulation/MILSIM.slx`.
- Modify `FCS/RC` module to select rc signal source (`Variant->Label Model Active Choice`). Currently there are two source supported:
	-  *Joystick* (default): A joystick should be connected to your PC.
	-  *Mavlink*: In this way, rc signal would be sent via mavlink protocol. Make sure you uncomment macro `FMT_OUTPUT_PILOT_CMD` in `$FMT_Firmware/fmt_fmu/target/pixhawk/fmtconfig.h`.
- Modify `Virtualization` module to select 3D environment.
	- *Matlab_3D*  (default): Matlab 3D Animation
	- *Flightgear*: Flightgear Simulator  
- Clock `Run` button to start the simulation.

### Open-loop Simulation

Follow the belowing steps to start open-loop simulation:

- Parse `blog.bin` log file and load **.mat* files into matlab workspace.
- Run `utils/log_parser/load_parameter.m` script to load model parameters from log file.
- Open the open-loop simulation model `$FMT_Model/simulation/OpenLoopSIM.slx`.
- Clock `Run` button to start the simulation.
